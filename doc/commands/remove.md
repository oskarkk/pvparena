# Remove Command

## Description

This command does only one thing: remove the arena. For safety, it asks you to use it two times before the arena is finally removed.

## Usage

Command |  Definition
------------- | -------------
/pa [arena] remove</br>/pa [arena] delete| remove an arena


Example: `/pa test remove` - remove the "test" arena

## Hazards

Well, once you did that, the associated file is deleted. So when unsure, either make backups or use 
[disable](disable.md) command instead of remove.
